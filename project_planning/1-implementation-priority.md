## Implementation Notes
1. Each phase should be completed and tested before moving to the next
2. Core functionality (Auth, Listings) must be solid before building purchase system
3. Review system comes last as it depends on completed purchases
4. Each feature should include:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Documentation
   - Security review

## Risk Mitigation
- Start Stripe integration early in development to handle potential issues
- Implement proper error handling from the beginning
- Ensure robust testing of authentication system
- Plan for data migration and schema changes
- Consider scalability in initial architecture
